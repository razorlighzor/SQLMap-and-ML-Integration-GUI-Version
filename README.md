# SQLMap-and-ML-Integration-GUI-Version

A hybrid web security assessment tool project designed to detect SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities using both AI-based analysis and the industry-standard SQLMap engine. Built for cybersecurity professionals and web application testers, the tool combines the speed and precision of traditional penetration testing with the adaptability of machine learning.

This tool is similar to SQLmap but I decided to create a GUI version of SQLmap with the addition that it can perform batch processing towards numerous vulnerable URL parameters. The default machine learning is set to Random Forest.
